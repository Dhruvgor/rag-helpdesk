ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE — FUNDAMENTALS

What is AI?
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the field of building systems that perform tasks which typically require human intelligence—perception, language understanding, planning, problem solving, and learning from data.

Key branches
- Machine Learning (ML): learning patterns from data to make predictions or decisions.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): working with text/speech (translation, summarisation, Q&A).
- Computer Vision (CV): understanding images/video (classification, detection, segmentation).
- Knowledge & Reasoning: logic, rules, search/planning, constraint solving.
- Robotics: perception–planning–control loops in the physical world.

Core concepts
- Agent & Environment: an AI agent senses the environment and acts to achieve goals.
- State & Action: the situation the agent is in and what it can do next.
- Reward/Objective: a measurable signal to optimise (e.g., accuracy, revenue, safety).
- Learning vs. Inference: learn parameters from data; then use the trained model to make predictions.

Common AI task types
- Classification: assign a label (spam / not spam).
- Regression: predict a number (house price).
- Ranking/Retrieval: order results by relevance.
- Generation: produce new content (text, code, images).
- Control: choose actions over time (robotics, recommendation bandits).

Data matters
- Data quality > model complexity; good labels and coverage reduce errors.
- Distribution shift: performance can drop when deployment data differs from training data.
- Monitoring is required post-deployment (drift, latency, cost, safety).

Limitations & risks
- Hallucinations in generative models; bias from data; privacy and IP risks; overfitting small datasets.
- AI ≠ full autonomy. Most production systems are human-in-the-loop.

Mini‑FAQ
Q: Is AI the same as ML?
A: ML is a major part of AI, but AI also includes rule‑based systems, planning, and search.

Q: Does a bigger model always mean better results?
A: Only if your data/compute/problem justify it. Data quality and evaluation often matter more.

Q: Why do models fail in production?
A: Data drift, unhandled edge cases, poor monitoring, and unclear objectives are common causes.
